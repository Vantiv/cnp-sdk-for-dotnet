Vantiv eCommerce .NET SDK
=====================

> **WARNING:**
> All major version changes require recertification to the new version. Once certified for the use of a new version, Vantiv modifies your Merchant Profile, allowing you to submit transaction to the Production Environment using the new version. Updating your code without recertification and modification of your Merchant Profile will result in transaction declines. Please consult you Implementation Analyst for additional information about this process.

Test
------

1. Create a c# class similar to:  

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using Cnp.Sdk;

    class Example
    {
[STAThread]
        public static void Main(String[] args)
        {
            CnpOnline cnp = new CnpOnline();
            sale sale = new sale();
            sale.orderId = "1";
            sale.id = "1";
            sale.amount = 10010;
            sale.orderSource = orderSourceType.ecommerce;
            contact contact = new contact();
            contact.name = "John Smith";
            contact.addressLine1 = "1 Main St.";
            contact.city = "Burlington";
            contact.state = "MA";
            contact.zip = "01803-3747";
            contact.country = countryTypeEnum.US;
            sale.billToAddress = contact;
            cardType card = new cardType();
            card.type = methodOfPaymentTypeEnum.VI;
            card.number = "4457010000000009";
            card.expDate = "0112";
            card.cardValidationNum = "349";
            sale.card = card;

            saleResponse response = cnp.Sale(sale);
            //Display Results
            Console.WriteLine("Response: " + response.response);
            Console.WriteLine("Message: " + response.message);
            Console.WriteLine("Cnp Transaction Id: " + response.cnpTxnId);
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }

```

2. Compile and run this file.  You should see the following result:

    Response: 000
